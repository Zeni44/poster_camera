# Studio Camera

A swep that allows you to take high res images. This uses the `poster` command.
<br>
It is recommended to add it as a client download (spawnicon)
# Warning

1. Do not set the `poster_size` command (or through the menu) too high. Garry's Mod is limited in usable RAM and will fail to produce an image due to insufficient memory. (collectgarbage to free up as much as possible)
2. If you do not see your image, check your console for a possible error

# Usage

Q > Weapons > Other > Studio Camera.
<br>
Behaves just like a normal camera would as it is using it as a base. Therefore if `gmod_camera` does not exist, so won't the Studio Camera.
<br>
Use `poster_menu` in console to view additional features.
# Commands
`poster_size` - number that gets multiplied with your screen resolution
<br>
`poster_menu` - opens a menu with settings
